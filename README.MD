# Hello
It's me, I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet.

To go over everything. They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing.

## Hello
Can you hear me?

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

## *Hello from the other side~*
