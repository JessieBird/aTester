# Hello
It's me, I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet.

To go over everything. They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing.

## Hello
Can you hear me?

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

### *Hello from the other side~*
### *I must've called a thousand times~*

## Notes for group members
### Requirement
1. A GitHub account
2. git install on your computer or IDE (e.g. VSCode or InteliJ)
3. Tell Jessie your GitHub account name, in order to be added as a collaborator. 
4. Make sure to accept the invitation on your GitHub.
5. Log in your GitHub account in your IDE.

### Initialize the project from GitHub
#### Using InteliJ IDE
1. Click the button on your left-top corner (just right besides the menu) that has a project name with an icon, and select 'Clone repository'
2. Select your GitHub account and find this repository.

#### Using other IDE (To be updated)
If you're using VSCode, I guess all you need to do is sign in your GitHub account in VSCode.
Then, search "How to import a repository from GitHub in VSCode" on Google.

### Using git to sync the project when other members are doing the jobs as well
#### Using InteliJ IDE
1. First is to update the local folder/files from GitHub repository, to see whether other members have contributed new lines/codes. (Skip this step if you just imported the whole project)
```declarative,
1. Click on the git icon (The one usually showing 'main')
2. Select 'Update Project'
```
2. After ensuring the local files are updated, then you can start contributing your part.
3. When you finish your part and make sure there is no bug in your code, you can start commit & push.
4. Commit: this step is to say the comments about the parts you just wrote.

```declarative, 
1. CLick the icon on the left bar, the one just below the files. Or your can click on the git icon (The one usually showing 'main')
2. Select the files you just wrote the new lines in. (Upper half of the pop-up section)
3. Write the comments about what you just did or the description of your effort. (Lower half of the pop-up section)
4. Click the 'commit' button (Or 'commit & push' button then you can skip next step)
  ```
5. Push: This step is to push (update) your code to the GitHub repository 
```declarative,
1. Click on the git icon (The one usually showing 'main')
2. Select 'Push'
3. Check on GitHub website to see whether your push is really worked.
```
#### Using other IDE (TO BE UPDATED)
You have to figure it out by yourself. (x
